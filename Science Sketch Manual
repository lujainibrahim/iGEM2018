<h1>Science Sketch Manual</h1>
<h2>Sketching</h2>

<ol class="a">
  <li>Select a topic for the sketch! It can be either about your project or any major techniques/principles that your team is using. </li>
  <li>Create a script of about 200-250 words (which will give you a video of about 1.5-2.5 minutes at the end).</li>
  <li>Separate the script into various storyboards. The simplest way to do this is to group 1-2 adjacent and relevant sentences into the same storyboard. </li>
  <li>Start designing each of your storyboards! Let your creative mind flow and draw out anything in your head! Not knowing where to start? Google is always your best friend! Take one of the storyboards for our sketch about iGEM as an example: In the fall, teams from all around the world travel to Boston to present their project and compete at the Giant Jamboree. </li>
  <li>Set up a camera (it is easier if you can get a tripod that can film tilted or downwards), find a place with good lighting (Natural light works quite well) and dive right into the fun! </li>
  <li>Different storyboards can be filmed individually and they can be combined when editing. It is ideal to find a buddy that can monitor the camera for you when you are sketching to ensure that the camera is working/focusing properly! </li>
  <li>Use A3 papers for sketching so that you have more space and that the corners of the paper won’t be included in the clips. Don’t forget to ask your buddy to mark the filming frame for you on the paper so you know where to/not to draw (it is alright to use pencil to slightly mark the four corners; it won’t be that noticeable in the video).  </li>
  <li>Use a lot of colors to make it colorful and fun! </li>
  <li>Don’t stress out and take your time when you are sketching! If you feel that you need to stop and think, just move your hand out of the filming frame while keeping the camera recording. These short periods can be edited our later! </li>
  <li>Don’t forget to record the soundtrack that will be used later when editing! Any recording app on your smartphone will do. Speak slowly and clearly, and make sure to pause in between sentences. </li>
  <li>Voila! You are done! Science sketch is fun and easy! </li>
</ol>

<h2>Editing</h2>
  <p>You can use almost any film editing software. We used DaVinci Resolve which is available online for free at https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/ 
If you choose to use Resolve, here’s a guide on how to edit your science sketch:</p>

<ol class="a">
  <li>Start a new project.</li>
  <li>Import all the media you need using the import tool in Resolve. </li>
  <li>Drag your media into your timeline: </li>
  		<ol class="b"> 
        	<li>Start off by dragging your audio files like the voiceover and any background music. </li>
            <li>Then, start dragging the first video file into the timeline. </li>
            <li>Delete the audio file associated with the video files every time you add them to the timeline to make sure you can only hear the voiceover /any background music.</li>
        </ol>
   <li>Split the audio clips into different parts that will correspond to different video clips using the splitting tool.</li>
   <li>Right click on the video clip, and click “change clip speed”.</li>
